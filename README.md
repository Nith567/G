# Welcome to Our Project

## Overview
Welcome to our project! We leverage the power of the Owl Protocol, a web3 integration platform that simplifies blockchain development by providing APIs and Zapier integration for any EVM blockchain. This allows developers to build blockchain applications without dealing with private keys, gas fees, or cryptocurrencies, enabling them to focus on the core aspects of their applications.

### Owl Protocol
The Owl Protocol abstracts away the complexities of blockchain technology, making it accessible and easy to integrate into various applications. Key features include:
- **APIs for Seamless Integration**: Provides robust APIs to interact with any EVM blockchain.
- **Zapier Integration**: Easily integrates with Zapier to automate workflows and processes.
- **No Private Keys Required**: Developers can build applications without handling private keys.
- **No Gas Fees**: Eliminates the need to manage or pay gas fees.
- **Focus on Application Development**: Simplifies blockchain interactions so developers can concentrate on building great applications.

### Contribution Rewards via Zapier Integration
Our project utilizes the Owl Protocol's Zapier integration to reward contributors automatically. Here's how it works:
- **Automatic NFT Minting**: When a contribution is merged into our GitHub repository, the contributor's email address triggers the minting of a unique cat collectible NFT.
- **Contract Details**: The NFTs are minted from the contract address `0x4DFe31D8B4207D7F119474f57727D2079F487010`, deployed on the Op-Raspberry Celestia network (RPC URL: `https://rpc.opcelestia-raspberry.gelato.digital`).
- **ERC721AutoId**: The collection uses the ERC721AutoId standard, allowing for the automatic generation of unique token IDs.
- **Engaging Experience**: This integration provides a fun and engaging way to reward contributors, fostering a sense of community and appreciation.
